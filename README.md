# Neural_Networks

Projects for Neural Networks class ECE NTUA 2021-2022. 

* 1st project(Supervised learning):\
We used two datasets (UCI and Kaggle) and experimented with various classifiers (dummy, k-nearest neighbors, gaussian naive bayes, Logistic Regression) in order to solve a classification problem. We also tuned the hyperparameters of each model using grid search cross validation.

* 2nd project(Unsupervised learning):\
We implemented a movie recommendation systme using word emmbeddings and then implemented topological and semantic movie illustration using self organizing maps (S0M).

* 3rd project(Deep learning):\
We implemented an image captioning system. We tuned the hyperparameters of the CNN models (InceptionV3 and NASNetLarge) and added more layers when it was deemed necessary.
